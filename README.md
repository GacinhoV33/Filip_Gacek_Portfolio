# Smallprojects

* [Brownian Motion](https://github.com/GacinhoV33/Brownian-Motion-Simulation)
</br> <br>
![Brownian Motion](/images/brownian.png)
The short simulation of brownian motions in python with using matplotlib library
</br> <br>

* [Automate downloads](https://github.com/GacinhoV33/Automate_downloads)
  This app helps to segregate files in directories. But it's main purpose is to automaticly copy files from downloads or screenshow_folder and segregate them in specified order.     That's may be unbelievably helpful for students in times of E-learning. Imagine that every screenshot you've taken is automaticly segregated into directories with name of          subject and time. This app enable you to do it.

* [OpenCV Game](https://github.com/GacinhoV33/OpenCV-Game.git)
 Short games which uses LUT operation to show how hit or miss operation works(Morphology).

 Few data structures implemented in python

# [Project of fan in SOLIDOWRKS](https://github.com/GacinhoV33/Fan-project)
* 3D construction in SOLIDKWORKS
* STL files ready to print in 3D printer
